          <p class="side-content">TRPWS organised a live session titled Pawsitivity on 27th May. This session comprised of a discussion about how people can help stray animals around them. Our esteemed guests for this session were Neha Singh, Assistant Professor KIET Group of Institutions, Ghaziabad and Garima Gupta, Team lead, IRIS Software. Both Neha Ma’am and Garima Ma’am are working actively for the welfare of the stray dogs, feeding them, providing them medicines and vaccines and looking after their overall well – being. There were around 300 viewers as our audience who actively participated by interacting with our guests, raising questions and putting their remarks. Neha ma’am delightfully shared her journey in this direction, how she had loved animals since her school days. She had this habit of feeding the leftover to stray dogs and cows, and gradually this love grew. She shared how animals had been her only support in despondent times. After her parents’ death, she felt shattered and when she couldn’t find anyone by her side, these animals became her support. Garima Ma’am’ too loves dogs and believes that a pug has been the lucky charm of her life. With this common love for dogs, the two animal lovers got united in their endeavors to ensure a better life for these innocent creatures Together they have distributed 200 kgs of food to dogs till now and work tirelessly to heal the wounded ones. When people were worried about their own selves during this pandemic, the two of them went out of their homes to look after the stray dogs. They involved the people of their community to contribute to this noble cause, whether it be a monetary contribution or giving of food for the street animals and they continue feeding 60 dogs daily. They shared with our viewers some tips to help stray animals. One can help the injured dogs by sprinkling Betadine powder on their wounds. And it would really be a kind gesture to keep water in old plastic utensils and mud pots for them. Moreover, instead of throwing the vegetable peels in the bin, one should feed it to the cows. Neha Ma’am and Garima Ma’am are carrying out their work from home, running their households and taking out time to care for the stray animals. Their determination is really commendable. They discussed about the dog therapy, which is really efficacious especially in today’s stressful lifestyle as dogs can prove to be your best buddies and help you relieve stress with their innocent gestures and play.    </div>
